# crop-prediction-analysis
The goal of this project is to evaluate agricultural data and forecast the best crops depending on a number of variables, including climate and soil quality. In order to help farmers make well-informed decisions and maximize crop productivity, the prediction is performed using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression algorithm and KMeans clustering.
